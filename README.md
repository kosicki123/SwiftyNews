# SwiftyNews

A port of [lamernews](https://github.com/antirez/lamernews) written in Swift, using [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor).

### Disclaimer

This project is in a very early stage and is experimental. The goal is to create a fully working version to be used in production as community curated list of resources about Swift and Apple in general.

## Building

You can build the app with `swift build`, then run `.build/debug/App` to
start the server. 

If you have `swiftenv`, run `swiftenv install` inside your root folder to
install the proper version of Swift.
